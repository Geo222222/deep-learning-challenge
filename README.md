Alphabet Soup Charity Funding Predictor

Project Overview
The Alphabet Soup Charity Funding Predictor is a machine learning project aimed at helping Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation, identify applicants for funding who have the highest likelihood of success. Using deep learning techniques, the project builds a binary classifier model that predicts whether an organization will be successful after receiving funding.
Dataset

The dataset provided by Alphabet Soup contains over 34,000 records of organizations that have received funding. It includes information such as:
•	APPLICATION_TYPE: Alphabet Soup application type.
•	AFFILIATION: Sector affiliation.
•	CLASSIFICATION: Government organization classification.
•	USE_CASE: Purpose for funding.
•	ORGANIZATION: Type of organization.
•	INCOME_AMT: Income classification.
•	SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS: Special considerations for the application.
•	ASK_AMT: Requested funding amount.
•	IS_SUCCESSFUL: Whether the organization was successful.

Project Steps
1. Data Preprocessing
The dataset was preprocessed to prepare it for training the model. Key preprocessing steps include:
•	Dropping irrelevant columns like EIN.
•	Binning infrequent categories in the NAME and CLASSIFICATION columns for better model performance.
•	Encoding categorical data using one-hot encoding with pd.get_dummies().
•	Scaling the features using StandardScaler() to improve model convergence.

2. Neural Network Model
The deep learning model was built using TensorFlow and Keras. The architecture of the model includes:
•	Input layer with features derived from the preprocessed dataset.
•	Three hidden layers with varying numbers of neurons (3, 14, 21) and ReLU activation functions.
•	Output layer with a single neuron using the sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

3. Model Training and Evaluation
•	The model was compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.
•	It was trained using 100 epochs, with a 15% validation split.
•	Initial performance did not meet the target accuracy of 75%, but through tuning and optimization, improvements were made.

4. Optimization Attempts
To improve the model’s performance:
•	Adjusted the structure by adding neurons and hidden layers.
•	Applied feature binning to rare categories.
•	Experimented with different training durations by tuning the number of epochs.
